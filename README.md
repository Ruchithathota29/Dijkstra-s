<p> This program implements Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to discover the shortest direction between two places on a fictional college campus. The graph is hardcoded the use of an adjacency listing and robotically transformed to a bidirectional format, permitting travel in both guidelines. Users enter a starting and ending location, and this system outputs the shortest travel time and path.</p>

For Example :
This is the input that i gave 

Enter starting location: Dorm</br>
Enter destination: Gym

And the output is 

Shortest travel time: 13 minutes</br>
Route: Dorm -> Library -> Lab -> Gym
